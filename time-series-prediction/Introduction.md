# Time Series Prediction

Time series prediction is the modeling for Time Series data 
(years, days, hoursâ€¦etc.)for predicting future values using 
Time Series modeling. This helps if your data is serially
correlated.

Time series can only be performed dependent on the set of time
series data provided.


## Advantages of Time series prediction

* Time Series Analysis Helps You Identify Patterns. Memories are fragile and prone to error
* Time Series Analysis Creates the Opportunity to Clean Your Data. 
* Time Series Forecasting Can Predict the Future.


This talks about the different forms of time series prediction 
such as; the ANOVA model used to determine whether a survey or 
experiment results are significant, ARIMA model which is a class 
of statistical models for analyzing and forecasting time series 
data, and the Temporal fusion Transformer which provides additional
insight on feature importance by utilizing self-attention when 
forecasting. we will get more into them as we processed. it also
talks about various features of time series such as the autocorrelation
of the time series which check the relationship between a variable
current value, and the previous one. stationary and non-stationary
time series which checks if a time series changes over time or not
, seasonal decomposition which entails viewing a time series as a 
trend, seasonality, and noise component, deseasonalising a time
series which is removing seasonality from the time series, detrending
of time series which is removing trends from a time series, Granger-casualty-test
which is used to check if a date can be predicted or not, lag-plot
a type of scatter plot in which the x and y-axis are lagged, 
SampleEntropy which is a technique for quantifying the amount of 
regularity and unpredictability for small time series, and smoothen 
of time series techniques used to remove fine-grained variation between time steps.
