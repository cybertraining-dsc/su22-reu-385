# Time Series Prediction

Time series prediction is basically the machine learning 
modeling for Time Series data (years, days, hoursâ€¦etc.)
for predicting future values using Time Series modeling .
This helps if your data in serially correlated.

## Advantages of Time series prediction

* Time Series Analysis Helps You Identify Patterns. Memories are fragile and prone to error
* Time Series Analysis Creates the Opportunity to Clean Your Data. 
* Time Series Forecasting Can Predict the Future.


This chapter talks about the different forms of time series 
prediction such as;ANOVA, Temporal Fusion Transformer and ARIMA . It
also talks about varius feature of time series such as  auto correlation, 
stationary and non-stationary, seasonal decomposition, deseasonalising a 
timeseries, detrend, Granger-casualty-test, lag-plot, SampleEntropy, and 
smoothen
