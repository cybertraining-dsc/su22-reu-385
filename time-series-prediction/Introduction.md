# Time Series Prediction

Time series prediction is the modeling for Time Series data 
(years, days, hoursâ€¦etc.)for predicting future values using 
Time Series modeling. This helps if your data is serially
correlated.

Time series can only be performed dependent on the set of time
series data provided.


## Advantages of Time series prediction

* Time Series Analysis Helps You Identify Patterns. Memories are fragile and prone to error
* Time Series Analysis Creates the Opportunity to Clean Your Data. 
* Time Series Forecasting Can Predict the Future.

## Time series algorithm

Time series can be done in different form be it the AI or 
non AI methods the table below classify each of the time 
series predicting algorithm in their method.

such as the ANOVA model used to determine whether a survey or
The experiment results are significant. The ARIMA model, which is a class
statistical model for time series analysis and forecasting,
and the Temporal fusion transformer, provide additional
insight on feature importance by utilizing self-attention when
forecasting. We will get more into them as we proceed. It also

To remove fine-grained variation between time steps, time series techniques are used.
