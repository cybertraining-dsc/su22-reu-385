# Sample Entropy

"Sample Entropy is similar to approximate entropy but is more consistent in estimating 
the complexity even for smaller time series. For example, a random time series with fewer
data points can have a lower ‘approximate entropy’ than a more ‘regular’ time series, 
whereas, a longer random time series will have a higher ‘approximate entropy’."
