##  Stationary and Non-Stationary Time Series

### Stationary Time series
A stationary time series has statistical properties or moments 
that do not change over time (for example, mean and variance).

The series' statistical properties, such as mean, variance, and 
auto correlation, remain constant over time. The auto correlation
of a series is simply the correlation of the series with its 
previous values.

#### How to make a time series stationary?

You can make series stationary by:

* Differencing the Series (once or more)
* Take the log of the series
* Take the nth root of the series
* Combination of the above

The most common and convenient method 
##### Differencing the Series (once or more)

If Y_t is the value at time 't,' the first difference of Y equals
Yt - Yt-1. To put it simply, differencing the series is simply subtracting
the next value from the current value.

If the first difference does not make a series stationary, the second 
differencing can be used. And so forth.

Consider the following sequence: [8, 6, 4, 10, 25].
First differencing gives: [6-8, 4-6, 10-4, 25-10] = [-2, -2, 6, 15]
Second differencing gives: [-2-(-2), 6-(-2), 15-6] = [0, 8, 9]

### Non-Stationary Time series

Data points are frequently non-stationary or have changing means,
variances, and covariances. Trends, cycles, random walks, and combinations 
of the three are examples of non-stationary behaviors.

While forecasting, it is recommended to convert a non-stationary series to a 
stationary series because autoregressive forecasting models are essentially linear
regression models that use the lag(s) of the series itself as predictors.


## How to test for stationary?

A method for determining whether a given series is stationary. This 
is possible with statistical tests known as 'Unit Root Tests.' There 
are several variants of this in which the tests determine whether a 
time series is non-stationary and has a unit root.

Unit Root tests are implemented in a variety of ways, which includes:

* Augmented Dickey Fuller test (ADH Test)
* Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin â€“ KPSS test (trend stationary)
* Philips Perron test (PP Test)
