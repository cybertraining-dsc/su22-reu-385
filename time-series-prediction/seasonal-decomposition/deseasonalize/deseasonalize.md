# Deseasonalizing Time Series Data

This is process of removing seasonality from time series 

There are several methods for deseasonalizing a time series. Here are a few :

* Take a moving average with length as the seasonal window. This will smoothen in series in the process.

* Seasonal difference the series (subtract the value of previous season from the current value)

* Divide the series by the seasonal index obtained from STL decomposition
